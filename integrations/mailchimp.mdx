Copy the API key store in your `.env` file

```ini

   ```

## MailChimp Server Region

Login to your Mailchimp account. In the browser URL bar you’ll find something similar to this:

`https://us21.admin.mailchimp.com/`

The `us21` is the server prefix we need. Store this in your `.env` file

```ini
MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER=MAILCHIMP_API_SERVER
```

## Tips

- **Security**: Ensure your API key and credentials are stored securely and not exposed in public repositories.
- **Testing**: Test the email functionality thoroughly in both development and production environments to ensure everything works correctly.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor your email campaigns and handle any issues, such as bounced emails or emails marked as spam.
- **Compliance**: Follow email marketing regulations and best practices to avoid having your emails marked as spam.

By following these steps, you will seamlessly integrate MailChimp into your SaaS boilerplate, allowing you to manage your email subscribers and send effective marketing campaigns.
