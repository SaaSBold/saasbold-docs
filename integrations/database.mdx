# Database

In this part of the documentation, let's set up a database for your SaaSBold project.

## The basics

SaaSBold uses PostgreSQL by default to store user accounts and application data, but you can switch to MySQL, MongoDB, or another database if needed.

Setting up your database takes just two steps:

1. Get a connection string from your database provider
2. Add it to your environment variables

## Getting your database connection string

Your database provider will give you a connection string that looks something like this:

```
postgres://username:password@hostname:5432/database_name
```

If you're using MongoDB instead, your connection string will look like:

```
mongodb://username:password@hostname:27017/database_name
```

## Setting up your project

1. Open your project's `.env` file
2. Update the `DATABASE_URL` variable:

```
DATABASE_URL="your_connection_string"
```

## Creating your database tables

Now let's set up your database schema using Prisma:

```bash
# Create the tables in your database
npx prisma db push

# Generate the Prisma client
npx prisma generate
```

That's it! Your database is ready to use.

## Updating your schema later

When you make changes to your database models in the Prisma schema file, remember to run:

```bash
npx prisma generate
```

This keeps your Prisma client in sync with your database structure.

## Switching databases

If you need to use a different database later, just update your connection string with the appropriate format for your new database provider.
