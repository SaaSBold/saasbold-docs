# Emails

In this part of the documentation, we will show you how to integrate SMTP to be able to send transactional emails and magic links for authentication.

## Overview

SaaSBold boilerplate supports email integration for sending transactional emails and authentication magic links. This is crucial for enhancing user engagement and communication within your SaaS application.

> **Note**\
> We will be using Resend as our SMTP provider, but you can use any SMTP provider you want.

Follow this guide to integrate Resend into your boilerplate seamlessly.

## Get The SMTP Credentials

Here are the steps to integrate SMTP into your Boilerplate.

1. Log in to your Resend account and go to your dashboard.
If you donâ€™t have one, go to [Resend](https://resend.com/) and click the "**Get Started**" button to create an account.

2. **Generate API Key:** Navigate to **Settings > API Keys** and then click on "Create API Key". A popup will appear for providing the name for your API key.

3. **View API Key**: Once you click "Add", a popup with the API key will appear. You can only see this key once, so copy it and store it in your `.env` file.

## Configuring SMTP Host and Port

1. **SMTP PORT and HOST:** Go to _Settings>SMTP_. You can see all of them here. Go ahead and copy these values.

2. **Update Environment Variables**: Open the `.env` file, Add the following lines, replacing the placeholders with the your credentials:

```ini
EMAIL_SERVER_HOST=
EMAIL_SERVER_PORT=
EMAIL_SERVER_USER=
EMAIL_SERVER_PASSWORD=YOUR_SMTP_PASSWORD # For Resend this will be your API KEY
EMAIL_FROM=
   ```

> **Important**\
> One last thing we have to do is verify the Domain. Without verifying the domain, the email will not reach the destination.

## Verify Domain

It is crucial to verify your domain to send transactional emails such as welcome messages, password resets, etc.

1. **Add Domain:** Go to **Settings > Domains** in Resend and click "Add Domain".

2. **Add DNS record:** Follow the on-screen instructions to verify your domain by adding DNS records.

3. **Verify DNS Record**: Once you have added DNS records, click on the "Verify DNS Records" button to verify.

If you get stuck, follow the official [documentation](https://resend.com/docs/introduction) by Resend on setting up the domain.

## Tips

- **Security**: Ensure your API key and SMTP credentials are stored securely and not exposed in public repositories.
- **Testing**: Test the email functionality thoroughly in both development and production environments to ensure everything works correctly.
- **Monitoring**: Monitor your email delivery and handle issues such as bounced emails or emails marked as spam.
- **User Experience**: Customize email templates to match your brand and provide a consistent user experience.

By following these steps, you will seamlessly integrate Resend into your SaaS boilerplate for efficient email delivery, enhancing user engagement and communication.
