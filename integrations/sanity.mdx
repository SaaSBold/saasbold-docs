# Sanity

SaaSBold comes with a fully functional blog with Sanity. In this part of the documentation, we are going to show you how to integrate Sanity and enable blog into your SaaS Boilerplate.

## Overview

Integrating Sanity into your SaaSBold boilerplate allows you to manage and publish content easily. Sanity provides a powerful content management system (CMS) that integrates seamlessly with your application. This guide will walk you through the steps to set up Sanity, configure it, and publish content.

Follow the Step-by-Step Guide to Integrate Sanity:

## Sanity Project

Let's start our integration process by utilizing the Sanity project.

1. **Initialize a Sanity project:** Run this command in a separate directory/folder and follow the instructions on the command line to initialize a project.

```bash
npm -y create sanity@latest
   ```

> **Note**\
   > We don't need the project created with this command. It'll create the project on the Sanity dashboard. You can delete the project folder from the directory after the project shows up on [sanity.io/manage](http://sanity.io/manage)

2. **Get the Project Name and ID:** To get the key, log in to [sanity.io/manage](https://www.sanity.io/manage) and go to the project you created earlier. When you go to the project, you’ll see `Project Name` and `ID.` Go ahead and copy it.

```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_ID=YOUR_SANITY_PROJECT_ID
NEXT_PUBLIC_SANITY_PROJECT_TITLE=YOUR_SANITY_PROJECT_TITLE
   ```

### Configuring Sanity Studio

1. **Add URL to Sanity Studio**: Go to `http://localhost:3000/studio` to add the URL. You’ll be redirected to a page that looks like this. Go ahead and click on **Continue.** It’ll take you to your Sanity Projects Dashboard.

After you’ve logged in, you’ll be redirected to Sanity Studio Dashboard. From the dashboard, you can post Articles and add Authors.

## Sanity Webhook Integration

We used Sanity webhook for on-demand data revalidation.

Follow the steps to integrate webhook:
