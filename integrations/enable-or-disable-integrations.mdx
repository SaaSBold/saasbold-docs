# Enable or Disable Integrations

In this part of the documentation you will learn how to enable or disable integrations.

SaaS Bold comes with more than 10 integrations. You might not need all the integrations for your project.

If you want you can disable integrations from the `integrations.config.tsx` file.\
To enable an integration set the specific integration variable to `true`, to disable it set it to `false`

You have to add the env variables for the enabled Integrations. Otherwise, the build will fail
