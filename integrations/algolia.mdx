# Algolia

In this part of the documentation, we will show you how to integrate Algolia into your Boilerplate.

## Overview

Integrating Algolia into your SaaSBold boilerplate will enhance your application's search functionality, providing your users with fast and relevant search results.

Follow the steps below to integrate Algolia:

## Step-by-Step Guide

1. **Create an Algolia Account**\
Log in to your [Algolia](https://www.algolia.com/) dashboard. If you don’t have an account, go ahead and create one.
2. **Create a project**\
Go to the dashboard, click on **Application** and, then click on the **Create Application** button. Follow the steps to create the application.

> **Note**\
   > It’ll create an unnamed application. If you prefer to change the name go to: Settings>Applications.

After creating the application you’ll be redirected to a page for importing data.

For now click on **Skip for now**, you can import data or use the crawler of Alogolia to extract data from your site later on.

3. **Application ID & Search API Key**

These values are for the below environment variables

```ini
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_APPLICATION_ID=
NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_SEARCH_API_KEY=
   ```

Alternatively, if you do not see this section below on the Overview page. You can go to your account settings>Applications

You’ll see a list of all the application you created. Click on the application you want to use for this project.

Now you’ll be redirected to this page. Click on **API Keys**

Now copy the **Application ID** and **Search API Key** and store it in your environment variables

4. **Create an Index Name**

From the Overview page click on **Data sources**

![Screenshot of Data Sources link on the Algolia Application's page](/images/docs/integrations/algolia/step-4-1.png)

Now from the **Indices** tab click on **Create Index**

![Screenshot of the Indices page with the Create Index button](/images/docs/integrations/algolia/step-4-2.png)

A modal will open, enter your preferred Index name.

A rule of thumb we suggest for naming the index: _Describes what it stores_. So your name will reflect the data Algolia will store on that index name. Additionally prefix the name with the environment you’ll be using it in(e.g development, production).

Now click on **Create**.

![Screenshot of the Create Index modal with an input field for the index name.](/images/docs/integrations/algolia/step-4-3.png)

Store this index name in your env. You’ll find a variable `NEXT_PUBLIC_ALGOLIA_INDEX_NAME`

By following these steps, you can successfully integrate Algolia into your SaaSBold boilerplate, providing an efficient search experience for your users.
