# Admin Access

The admin dashboard is only accessible to the users whose **role** is set to **ADMIN**\
To give yourself admin privilege add your email to the **ADMIN_EMAILS** `.env` variable before registering with that email.

```ini
ADMIN_EMAILS=youremail@gmail.com
```

If you want to add other users as admin, you can add their emails as a comma-separated list.

```ini
ADMIN_EMAILS=youremail@gmail.com,sam@gmail.com,jhon@gmail.com
```

This will set the **role** to **ADMIN** for these users, and it will enable all the features on the Admin dashboard for these users.
