# Installation

In this part of the documentation, we are going to show you how to install and deploy the SaaSBold Boilerplate.

Before we start the installation process make sure you have Node.js installed on your machine.\
Otherwise, the installation commands won't work.

Follow these steps to install the template:

1. Download the zip file from [SaaSBold](https://saasbold.com/pricing)

2. Extract the zip file and _cd_ into the template folder. Now run this command to install the dependencies:

```bash
npm install
# or
yarn install
   ```

> Some included packages causes peer-deps issue with React 19 while installing.With npm the `--legacy-peer-deps` flag is a workaround for that at the moment.

Follow these steps below to complete all the integrations:

1. [Database](https://saasbold.com/docs/installation#id-1.-database)
2. [Authentication](https://saasbold.com/docs/installation#id-2.-authentication)
3. [Stripe](https://saasbold.com/docs/integrations/stripe)
4. [Sanity](https://saasbold.com/docs/integrations/sanity)
5. [Algolia](https://saasbold.com/docs/integrations/algolia)
6. [Mailchimp](https://saasbold.com/docs/integrations/mailchimp)
7. [Resend](https://saasbold.com/docs/integrations/emails)

When you are done with all the integration, now you can start the project on the local server

```sh
npm run dev
```

Itâ€™ll start the template on http://localhost:3000

## Deploying on PaaS

If you are using a GitHub repo then you can go with free-of-cost and easy-to-use options like [Vercel](https://vercel.com/), or [Netlify](https://netlify.com/) they offer decent-free tiers for Next.js hosting.

Since we are using Prisma ORM, make sure to edit the build command like this while deploying to Vercel.

![Build command override on Vercel](/images/docs/installation/build-command-override.png)

```bash
prisma generate && npm run build
```
