- **Heading**: The main title that introduces the pricing section, emphasizing the affordability and simplicity of your plans.
- **Description**: Supporting text that provides additional context about the pricing plans and their benefits.
- **Pricing Plans**: Different tiers of pricing plans are tailored to various customer needs, each with a specific name, target audience, description, price, features, and a call-to-action button.

## Steps to Customize

**Locate the Pricing Component File**: Open the Pricing component file located in `components/Home/Pricing/index.tsx`.

**Update the Heading**: Modify the Title to reflect your pricing strategy and the value offered.

```tsx
title={"Simple Affordable Pricing"}
```

**Update the Description:** Enhance the description to provide compelling reasons why users should choose your plans.

```tsx
description = "Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetur...";
```

## Customize Pricing Plans

**Locate Pricing Data File:** Open the pricing data file located in the `pricing/pricingData.ts`.

**Update Pricing Data:** Update each pricing plan with relevant details, including the plan name, target audience, description, price, included features, and icon.

```tsx
...
{
	priceId: "price_xxxxxx",
	unit_amount: 99 * 100,
	nickname: pricingPlans[0].name,
	description: pricingPlans[0].description,
	subtitle: pricingPlans[0].for,
	includes: pricingPlans[0].included.items,
	icon: `/images/pricing/pricing-icon-01.svg`,
},
...

```

**Review and Save**: After customizing the pricing plans, ensure they are clearly presented and accurately reflect your product's offerings. Save the file and verify the changes.
