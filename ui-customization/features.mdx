## Steps to Customize the Features Component

To customize the features section of the SaaSBold boilerplate, follow these steps to update the various elements, such as the heading, supporting headline, feature titles, feature descriptions, and icons.

**Locate the Features Component File**: Open the Features component file located in the components/Home/Features/index.tsx.

**Update the Title:** Find the main title element in index.tsx for the features section and update it to reflect the main introduction of your features.

```tsx
title = "Launch SaaS Startup in Days";
```

**Update the Supporting Description:** Modify the supporting headline/description to summarize the features section briefly.

```tsx
description =
	"Everything you need to build, launch, and scale your SaaS startup.";
```

### Update Feature Titles and Descriptions

1. Go to `dictionary/en.json` file
2. Update feature titles and descriptions in `homepage.features_section.features`.

```json
{
	"title": "Ready-to-Use Integrations",
	"description": "Database (Postgres with Prisma ORM)......."
}
```

**Update Icons**: Within `/public/images/features` you'll see icons with names like `feature-icon-01.svg`, `feature-icon-02.svg`, etc. Replace these icons with your custom icons. Keep the naming convention consistent.

**Review and Save**: After making changes, review the updated features section to ensure it effectively communicates the product's key benefits. Save the file and check the changes.
